# Enumerable

Enumerable is a simple "Hello World" example project, demonstrating how to enumerate over the NFTs in an ERC-721 contract and display the associated image for each and every one of them.

This project depends on [Delphereum](https://github.com/svanas/delphereum), a web3 implementation for the Delphi programming language.

Once compiled and running, simply enter the address of an ERC-721 contract on [BNB Chain](https://www.bnbchain.org/), then hit Refresh.

Note: [NFTKEY](https://nftkey.app/) is an awesome marketplace to discover enumerable ERC-721s on BNB Chain.
