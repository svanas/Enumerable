# NFT

NFT is a simple "Hello World" example project, demonstrating how to enumerate over the NFTs in a token contract and display the associated image for each and every one of them.

This project depends on [Delphereum](https://github.com/svanas/delphereum), a web3 implementation for the Delphi programming language.

Once compiled and running, simply enter the name (or address) of a NFT token contract on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) blockchain, then hit Refresh.

The 1st time you run this project, it will prompt you for your ([Infura](https://infura.io/) or [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/)) API key. Enter your API key, close Notepad, and save changes to the TXT file. You are then good to go.
